// Log View State — how much of the timeline is on screen, and which of it.
//
// /works carries more information than any one reading of it can use: 25
// commits, ~37 pieces of rich media, three eras. Folded, the page is a
// two-screen overview and every cover is invisible; fully unfolded it is a
// thirteen-screen media wall with no overview left. The two states people
// actually want — "show me everything at once" and "let me see the work" —
// are the same page at two different densities, plus the ability to narrow
// what is in it.
//
// This module is the vocabulary for both, and the URL codec that makes a
// reading shareable. It is deliberately free of React and of `lib/log`'s
// data layer: the parse/serialize pair is the whole contract, so the query
// string stays the single source of truth for view state.

// =============================================================================
// Form — how much of each commit is printed, as a composition.
//
// A row is made of a few independent parts: the title line (always), the
// description, the attachment object, the notes under it, and whether it
// peeks on hover. Each part has its own small set of states (`RowForm`), and
// a *form* is one preset of all of them — so the three readings of the page
// are compositions of the same atoms, and switching form is resetting every
// row to a preset rather than four hand-made layouts. A row the reader opens
// by hand is the same thing at a smaller scale: it takes the `feed` preset
// for itself (see TimelineCommit).
//
//  - `index`  — the title line only. The overview: one row per commit, the
//    whole career in two screens. Rich media is reachable but not shown
//    (hover peek on a pointer device, or open the row).
//  - `covers` — the default: the title, two lines, and the covers at a size
//    you can recognise a slide or a screenshot at. Still one row per commit,
//    so the overview survives, but the work is on screen rather than behind
//    a hover a phone cannot perform.
//  - `feed`   — every row open: the whole description, the attachment grid
//    with its captions written out, the notes and the author fields. All the
//    information is right there, so nothing in it peeks or opens a sheet: a
//    video plays where it is, a card goes to its page. Rows do not fold
//    one-by-one — cover and caption are one door, and leaving the feed is
//    a form change.
//
// The page borrowed git's vocabulary for these once (`--oneline`, `--stat`,
// `-p`); those names still parse, as aliases, so old links keep working.
